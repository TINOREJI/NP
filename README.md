# Thermal Infrared Object Detection For Aerial Crafts 

Thermal infrared object detection for aerial crafts is a cutting-edge technology that enables unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and drones to identify and locate objects or subjects using thermal imaging. This capability is particularly valuable in applications such as search and rescue, surveillance, and monitoring, where traditional optical cameras may be limited by poor visibility or low light conditions. By detecting heat signatures, these systems enhance the effectiveness of aerial platforms, making them indispensable tools for various industries, including public safety, agriculture, and infrastructure inspection.

##  Project
->This project is worked with tools like Tensorflow, Flask, YOLOv8

->When you install requirements.txt and make Flask Environment you can directly call the project.
## Run Locally
Create and activate an virtual environment, as follows:
```bash
  $ cd PROJECT
  $ python -m venv env
  $ env/Scripts/activate
```
Install Requirements

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After that, you can run the following command and access the application at 127.0.0.1:5000 on your browser.
```bash
  $ python app.py
```
